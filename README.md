Dataset with ltable and rtable tuples along with similarity scores: https://drive.google.com/file/d/11AVSZvzHyK9cL4_Aa2aqr-slNtcSh2MK/view

Best title model: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/106mX_VwXqpSgnyVcBhkQxnUh1WqD5dCC

Best Category model: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-4ccOlmMHnkYj_xTSY9dSvn1UgTJ70eT
